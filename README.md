<h1>**Yahoo-Troll-Question-Detection**</h1>

**Problem Statement**-As a last-ditch attempt to give Yahoo Answers some legitimacy in the era of Quora and Reddit, Yahoo's CEO Merissa Meyer has tasked us with creating a machine learning model to detect spam and troll questions so that they can be removed.

This is a problem statement for which we need NLP(Natural Language Processing). 

But why NLP? Here our goal is to create a machine learning model to screen questions and classify them as troll and non troll .NLP helps us with this by analysing the text. NLP analyzes text and understands the sentiments behind it.

**Evaluation**-The evaluation metric for this competition is the F1 score for comparing your predictions for "target" and the actual ground truth. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
